# weather-app

This is a simple weather-app made in vueJS, the same one you have surely stumbled on through your vueJS journey... note that this repo is for testing purposes only and should be viewed and taken as such. There CAN and WILL be strange things happening in it so take care. 

<h1> Pls attain your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/ and insert it on line 36 of App.vue </h1>
 
I've put in comments to better navigate through the code in the 'helpMe.vue' file
